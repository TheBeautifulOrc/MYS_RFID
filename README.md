# SimpleRFID
This project was created to support the [Make Your School](https://www.makeyourschool.de) hacks.

The [Groove - 125KHz RFID Reader](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-125KHz_RFID_Reader/)
is a simple sensor that can be used with an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc)
microcontroller. This library makes it easy to use the RFID reader to detect and
read RFID tags, like chips or cards.

## Installation

Before you can use `SimpleRFID` in your Arduino hacks you need to install the
library. This section will guide you through the installation process.

1. [Download](https://github.com/TheBeautifulOrc/SimpleRFID/archive/master.zip) the current version of the `SimpleRFID` library
2. Open the Arduino IDE
3. Select `Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library`
4. Select the downloaded archive from Step `1`

You can verify the installation by selecting `Sketch > Include Library`. There
should be a new entry in the menu with the name `SimpleRFID`.

## First Steps

To get familiar with the functionalities provided by `SimpleRFID` we recommend to
have a look at the [examples](examples/).
