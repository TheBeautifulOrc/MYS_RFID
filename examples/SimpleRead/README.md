# SimpleRead

This example demonstrates how you can use `SimpleRFID` to read the ID from a near RFID tag.

## Materials

To run this example you need these components:
- [Arduino](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-genuino/boards-modules)
- [Groove RFID Reader](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-125KHz_RFID_Reader/)
- At least one RFID tag (chip or card)
- Wires
- (Optional) Breed Board

## Setup

1. Open the example skecth by selecting `File > Examples > SimpleRFID > SimpleNoise`
2. Connect your Ardunio to your PC
3. Upload the code to your Arduino
4. Open the serial monitor by selecting `Tools > Serial Monitor`

## Usage

Hold a RFID tag close to the RFID reader and look at the monitor. The monitor
